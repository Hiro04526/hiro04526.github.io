          Hi, I’m Hiro, a passionate Computer Science student at De La Salle University Manila, with a focus on Software Technology. I love solving problems—whether it’s through designing intuitive user interfaces, coding creative solutions, or bringing technical ideas to life in fun and engaging ways.

          Over the years, I’ve worked on projects that reflect my curiosity and creativity, like developing GUIs in Java and designing & developing websites and mobile apps. These experiences have been incredibly rewarding, giving me the tools to turn complex ideas into something that feels simple and natural for people to use.
